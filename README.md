# Street-Ludo
Street Ludo is a modern twist on the classic board game Ludo, inspired by the version played in my childhood neighborhood. Unlike traditional Ludo, this game uses two dice per turn, adding new strategies and unpredictability. Players can choose between Easy Mode and Hard Mode, each with unique rules for how tokens are kicked and bailed out.
